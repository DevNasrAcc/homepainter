  <p>We and You are responsible for paying our respective filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with the rules of the arbitration service, provided that if the arbitrator determines that You cannot afford the filing fees and costs of the arbitration, then we shall pay all costs and filing fees associated with the arbitration proceeding.  Each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorney fees unless determined otherwise by the arbitrator.</p>
  <p>The arbitration will take place in Des Moines, Iowa unless by means phone conference, Skype or other means as determined by the arbitrator or as agreed by You and us.</p>
  <p><strong>YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATION ADJUDICATION OF YOUR CLAIM WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>IF, FOR ANY REASON, A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, THEN YOU AND US EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE ADJUDICATION OF YOUR CLAIM WILL BE SOLELY BY A JUDGE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong></p>
