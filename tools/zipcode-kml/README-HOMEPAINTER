I found this program initally in this stackoverflow
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23297117/zip-code-boundaries-using-google-maps-api

Which lead me to here
https://github.com/tomeralmog/zipcode-kml

The link he references https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/kml/kml_zcta.html no longer works.
But, it had a key piece of information "kml_zcta"

Google "kml_zcta" and you'll find something along the lines of "Cartographic Boundary Files - KML"
For instances this website https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/kml-cartographic-boundary-files.html is the government website for gis data.

Look for "ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)" and download the zip. It has an kml file that has all of the information needed.
The tags "<SimpleData name="ZCTA5CE10">00601</SimpleData>" inside cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k.kml correspond to the zip codes.
Then the coordinates are listed for the boundaries.
